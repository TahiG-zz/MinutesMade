MinutesMade

How might we make meetings more useful?

The what
MinutesMade is a computer software that leverages the best in dictaction to accurately capture every word of the meeting from every participant. At the end of each meeting, everyone is emailed a copy of the miinutes and actions they've agreed to.

The how
MM leverages the very best dictation software to accurately capture human speech. 
It uses AI and machine learning to improve its ability to identify words, accents, cultural phrases and even industry-specific/company-specific terminology. 
It does this in two ways:
1. It analyses general trends in speech in the wider world
2. It analyses specific speech inside the company
Lastly, it uses voice recognition software to detect who's speaking. The more it hears you speak the better it becomes at knowing who you are and what you're saying, no matter your accent.

The why
Many meetings are frought with frustration. They are tiresome and its easy to become distracted. Many walk away confused about what needs to be done next or who needs to be doing it. This leads to more communication (and sometimes more meetings!) that could've been avoided.

For big businesses with hundreds and thousands of employees, its imperative that each person knows what's expected of them and that stakeholders have oversight. This will help boost efficiency many fold and increase accountability. People will use the clarity to take ownership of their role and the tasks it comes with. 

Issues
- Issue 1: Companies might feel transcription of their upcoming plans pose a security risk.
- Solution 1: Encrypt the plaintext on a private blockchain where access is restricted to authorised devices. This could also help distribute the minutes with other company offices.
