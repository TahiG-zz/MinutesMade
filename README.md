MinutesMade

What's the idea?
MinutesMade is a software that takes meeting minutes. It works without prompt and without the need to set up each time. 

How does it work?
MinutesMade uses speech-to-text technology to accurately capture every word of the conversation.
It uses AI and machine learning to get better at identifying words, cultural phrases and even company-specific terminology. It analyses general trends in speech outside of the company and speech inside the company to get better at identifying terminology and meaning (while never letting the two data sets meet).
It uses voice recognition software to detect who's speaking and assign their name to the speech. The more it hears you speak the better it becomes at knowing who you are and what you're saying, no matter your accent.
