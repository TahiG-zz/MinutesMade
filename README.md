# MinutesMade

### _How might we make meetings more useful?_

## What
MinutesMade is a software-only product created to make meetings more useful. 

MinutesMade records conversations and meetings to automatically create minutes and distribute actions, take aways and follow ups to attendees. 

## How
MinutesMade combines the best in dictaction, machine learning and voice recognition to record, interpret and continually improve its understanding/speaker recognition. 

MM is platform-agnostic and can be installed on any Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android software.

## Why
Meetings are crucial for aligning people but most are frought with frustration. They are often longer than they need to be and its easy to become distracted. A lot of people walk away from them unsure about what needs to be done next and who needs to be doing it. This leads to costly misunderstandings (and more meetings!) that could've been avoided.

In businesses big and small, people need clarity around what's expected of them. MM provides this clarity through automated minutes and a record of commitments/next steps. This increases increases individual accountability. Through this accountability, people can then take ownership of their role and the tasks that come with it.
